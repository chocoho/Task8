# OVERALL TASK - 8
**Create Visual for ETAS and Alarm Data in Report** 
- understand the parameters of the model
- what are our axes
- PDF versus CDF
- create graph output for the coordinate data we receive from the analyzers - output the two graphs on the same coordinate plane
 - create a residual plot to compare the two models
 - is there a correlation between the two models? Is the residual plot white noise?
- how do we determine the fit between the lines in the plot?


# S.M.A.R.T. GOALS for this Tuesday

**1) SPECIFIC**
- Understand the paper, and get a clearer picture of the problem
 - Reread the paper: http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.imsc/1207580090
 - Read 1,2,5,6 more thoroughly
- Understand the parameters of the ETAS model
 - read: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ETAS/ETAS.pdf

**2) MEASUREABLE**

**3) ATTAINABLE** 

**4) RELEVANT**
- By looking at the other groups, it looks like the curators are going to output the data into CSV files

**5) TIME-BOUND**
- By Sunday 10PM: post rough draft for SMART goals
- By Sunday 11:59 PM: finish writing out smart goals, and contact Aaron to check
